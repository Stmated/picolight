A project where I try to create as good a project as possible for handling LED lights on the Raspberry Pico.

The idea is to create one as fast and versatile as possible.

This is done by creating algorithms that require virtually no memory, and have very high refresh rates.

Future plans:
* Create better dimming by dithering between two levels of lights
* Create better adjustments to accomodate differences between different lights
* Handle RGB and RGBW on the same strips
* Handle multiple lines of strips connected to diffrent GPIO ports
* Easier and fast configuration to setup according to your own lights (hardcoded at the moment)
